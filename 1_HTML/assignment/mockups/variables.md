# Margins & Paddings, sizes and positionning :

## Top menu bar

- Menu links have a vertical padding of 10px, horizontal padding of 15px.
- Top menu bar has a fixed height of 75px.
- Links are vertically centered in the top menu bar.

## Main content

- All the content of the page is in a space of 1070px, horizontally centered.
  The right and left margin are automatic. This includes the content of the top
  menu bar as well as the main content of the page.
- The gutters (between columns and row of the layout grid) are 20px wide.

## Left content panel

- The left panel takes 1/4 of the available main content space.
- The green background item has a vertical padding of 15px, horizontal padding of 20px.
- The white background items have a padding of 20px in all directions.

## Right content panel

- The right panel takes 3/4 of the available main content space.
- Each card in the right panel takes 50% of the space available (accounting for the gutter width).
- You can set a fixed height to the cards, given the text fits in 2 lines. It's not the ideal 
  solution but it will be easier in the context of this assignment.
